During the last few years, I have been involved with the <a
href="http://www.deutsche-schuelerakademie.de/">Deutsche SchülerAkademie</a>, a
16-day long summer school for particularly motivated and talented students aged
17/18 in Germany. I first taught courses on special relativity and biochemistry
& ethics and am now serving as one of its directors, where I lead one of the
schools. Please reach out if you would like to teach there, or simply know more
about the programme.  </p>
