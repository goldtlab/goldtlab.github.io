I will be teaching two courses in the academic year 2020/2021 within the [SISSA
Data Science PhD
programme](https://www.sissa.it/dipartimento-di-eccellenza). More information
will follow.

Introduction to neural network (Spring term 2021)
---

The goal of this course is to introduce students to modern approaches to
learning that involve neural networks and that are often summarised as “deep
learning” (DL).

Current topics in the theory of neural networks (Summer term 2021)
---

This class will give an overview over several areas of current research interest
in the theory of neural networks. Our focus will be on modern approaches to
understand the interplay of data structure, learning algorithm and architecture
in the context of machine learning.
