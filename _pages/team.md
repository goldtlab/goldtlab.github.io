<div style="font-size:130%; font-weight:bold">Sebastian Goldt</div><br/> I am
Assistant Professor in the nascent Department of Data Science at SISSA, where I
am currently setting up my group.

I studied physics at Cambridge University and did my PhD with Udo Seifert at the
University of Stuttgart, where I worked on the stochastic thermodynamics of
learning. Before coming to Trieste, I spent three years as a post-doc with
Florent Krzakala and Lenka Zdeborova in Paris studying the theory of neural
networks.</p>
